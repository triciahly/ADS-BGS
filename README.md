# ADS-BGS
This project aims to analyze ground movement in regions with potential karst development, focusing on areas with halite bedrock. We utilise various data sources, including InSAR and LiDAR, to monitor and assess ground displacement over time. The goal is to identify potential geohazards such as subsidence, sinkholes, and tectonic shifts.
