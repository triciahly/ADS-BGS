This project aims to analyse ground movement in regions with potential karst development in the Cheshire region, focusing on areas with halite bedrock. We utilise various data sources, including InSAR and LiDAR, to monitor and assess ground displacement over time. The goal is to identify potential geohazards such as subsidence, sinkholes, and tectonic shifts and other geological and hydrogeological conditions align to increase karst susceptibility. Based on these findings, targeted mitigation strategies are recommended for high-risk areas prone to karst development.
